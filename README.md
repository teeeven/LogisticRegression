# LogisticRegression

This is a repository for Binary and Multi-Class Classification projects using Logistic Regression.

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, which means predicting one of two possible outcomes (positive class and negative class).  It can be used for a wide range of binary classification problems, such as spam detection, churn, disease diagnosis, and credit risk analysis.

In logistic regression, a mathematical function called the sigmoid function is used to transform the input features into a probability of belonging to one of the two classes.

It is trained on a set of input features and their corresponding binary target values. The model learns to assign weights to each feature to predict the probability of belonging to one of the classes.

The output of the model is a probability value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the likelihood of belonging to one of the classes. If the probability value is greater than a certain threshold, the model assigns the corresponding label to the input. This threshold is ultimately determined by the builder of the model, stakeholders, and others collaboratively.
